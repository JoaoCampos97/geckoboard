customer success champion role

This is the first time that I have tried to create a dataset. I've been dealing with customer support for a long time now and am quite interested in learning more about Python etc.
However, due to the lack of time right now due to my current work (I've been doing overtime to help out with our big queue) I haven't been able to research and educate myself.

I hope that I'm able to continue on and do the interviews for this role as I'd really like to get to know geckboard more and what this role offers. My technical skills may not be sharp right now,
but it's a matter of sitting down, going through lessons and reading. If I get this opportunity, I will do everything that I have, to excel at my role and improve my skills.

Thank you for reading this!
